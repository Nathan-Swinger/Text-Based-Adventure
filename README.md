# Text-Based-Adventure
A text based adventure game made using C++ (WIP)

What I learned:
- Working with structures, accessing and updating data within them
- Working with switches and choosing a case based on active user input
- Random number generation to choose a random structure of data that would correspond to a random monster spawn

To work on in future:
- Inventory management
- Possibly refactor and condense inventory/combat code
- Separate functions and classes into different files if game expands too much more for management purposes
